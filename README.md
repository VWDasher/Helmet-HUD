Design a Pi Zero W Motorcycle Helmet HUD
Using a Pi Zero W and a small OLED screen - I hope to project an image on the faceshield that can be seen by the rider.  The Pi should be able to get key items - like speed, directions and current time from a bluetooth link to a smartphone.  
I have done some testing and it seems that while most people can't see an item really close to the eye - you can usually see something in a reflection close to the eye.  I hope to use this to project the data from the OLED screen onto the faceshield.  The idea is to keep it simple - if it works more capablity can be added later.
